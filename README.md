This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) TypeScript project with Apollo client for Graphql

## To Successfully Run and Play Around

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the apollo server:

```bash
npm run server-start
```

If you see `ðŸš€ Server ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql` in your terminal - everything went as planned and you can npw access your graph using this address

Then, run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
